# current environment image
In AWS CodeBuild, the "current environment image" refers to the specific set of software and dependencies that are provided by AWS in a pre-configured build environment. This environment image is used as the foundation for your build and determines the tools, runtimes, and packages available during the build process.


When you define the runtime version in your buildspec.yml file, you are specifying the version of the language runtime or tools you want to use within the context of the current environment image. This allows you to customize the environment to some extent while still building on top of the provided image.

For example, if you specify a Python runtime version in your buildspec.yml, it will determine which version of Python is available in the current environment image and make that version accessible for your build.

In summary, the current environment image in AWS CodeBuild provides a consistent and managed environment for your builds, ensuring that your projects can be built in a controlled and predictable manner, and it gives you the flexibility to work with various runtimes and tools while leveraging the underlying image.
