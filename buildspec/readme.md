In AWS CodeBuild, the buildspec.yml file is used to define the build and deployment phases for your project. The buildspec.yml file contains a series of build phases, including install, pre_build, build, post_build, and artifacts, which are executed in order during the build process. The install phase is one of these phases, and it is responsible for specifying the runtime version and performing any installation steps necessary for your build environment.

The install phase typically includes the following tasks:

Specifying the runtime version: You can use the runtime-versions section within the install phase to specify the runtime version or environment you want to use for your build. For example, you can specify the version of programming language runtimes, tools, or packages you need for your build.

Installing dependencies: You can use this phase to install any dependencies or packages required for your build. This could include things like package managers (e.g., npm, pip), third-party libraries, or any custom tools you need to build your application.

Here is an example of what the install phase in a buildspec.yml file might look like:

```
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.9
    commands:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt

```
